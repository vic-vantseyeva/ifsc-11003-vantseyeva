Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement
Reading the article “Understanding Progressive Enhancement” by Aaron Gustafson helped me understand
progressive enhancement as a metod for building the web from the ground up. First, you deliver the
core content and functionality using simple semantic HTML, and that becomes the foundation. Then
you layer on styling (CSS) to make it look good , and only after that add on interactivity with
JavaScript. The idea is like a layer-cake or peanut m&m as Gustafson describes where the peanut
is the content, the chocolate coating is CSS, and the candy shell is JavaScript.
I think this approach matters a lot today. By building this way, you can ensure that every user can
access your content, improve accessibility and reliability, get better performance, since the
essential parts load first, and make the site resilient for the future, since you don’t depend
solely on JavaScript or cutting-edge browser features.
From a modern web-development perspective where people access sites on everything from various
devices and internet connections progressive enhancement seems to be the responsibleway to build.
It respects different user contexts, but still allows modern users to benefit.
I read another article on the topic, this one from MoldStud: https://moldstud.com/articles/p-embracing-progressive-enhancement-in-responsive-web-design-boost-user-experience-and-accessibility?utm_source=chatgpt.com.
It shows how content-first HTML, layered CSS, and conditional JavaScript mkae websites that stay
usable on older browsers/devices while still offering modern experiences on modern platforms
