    <h2>Behavior & Social Structure</h2>
    <p>
      Hyenas are among the most socially complex mammals on Earth. Their clans operate with cooperation,
      intelligence, and a clear hierarchy that supports hunting, scavenging, and raising young.
    </p>

      <h3>Social Structure</h3>
      <div class="cards">
        <article class="card">
          <h4>Matriarchal Clans</h4>
          <p>
            Hyena clans are led by a dominant female, and rank is inherited through the maternal line.
            Even young females outrank adult males in most interactions.

        <article class="card">
          <h4>Cooperative Power</h4>
          <p>
            Clan members work together to defend territory, share food, and coordinate pack movements
            during hunting or patrolling.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h4>Territorial Life</h4>
          <p>
            Hyenas maintain large territories and use scent marking, calls, and patrols to establish borders.

      <h3>Communication & Vocalizations</h3>
      <p>
        Hyenas are extremely vocal, using a range of sounds for social bonding, warnings,
        group organization, and conflict.
      </p>

      <div class="cards">
        <article class="card">
          <h4>The “Laugh”</h4>
          <p>
            The hyena laugh signals excitement, stress, or submission. It is not actually laughter,
            but a complex social vocalization.
          </p>

        <article class="card">
          <h4>Whoops & Calls</h4>
          <p>
            Long-distance “whoops” allow clan members to coordinate across miles of terrain.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h4>Body Language</h4>
          <p>
            Ear position, tail height, and posture communicate confidence, fear, or social rank.

      <h3>Hunting Strategies</h3>
      <p>
        Hyenas are not the scavengers they're often portrayed as, as they are highly effective hunters.
        They rely on endurance, teamwork, and complex planning.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Work in small coordinated groups</li>
        <li>Communicate during hunts to corner prey</li>
        <li>Use stamina to exhaust larger animals</li>
        <li>Consume nearly every part of the carcass</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Daily Behavior Patterns</h3>
      <p>
        Hyenas are mostly nocturnal, spending daylight hours resting in shaded areas or dens.
